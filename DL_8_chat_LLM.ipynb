Here's an example code:\\n```\\nfor i in range(1, 6):\\n    print(i)\\n```\\nThis will output:\\n```\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n``` \\nThe `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers starting at 1 and ending at 5 (not including 6). The `for` loop then iterates over each number in this sequence, printing it out. You can modify the range() function to display any other numbers or sequences you need!\"]"
