## üìå Overview

This project explores the application of **transfer learning** for image classification using the **ResNet-50d** model, a high-performance convolutional neural network architecture pretrained on **ImageNet**. The aim is to classify images efficiently and evaluate the viability of leveraging pretrained CNNs for custom datasets.

### üß© Problem Statement

Training deep convolutional networks from scratch requires vast data and computational resources. For many real-world scenarios‚Äîespecially with limited labeled data‚Äîfine-tuning a pretrained model offers a practical solution. This project demonstrates how to use a pretrained ResNet-50d model for accurate object classification on custom image data.

### üîç Approach

The solution uses the **`timm`** library to load the ResNet-50d architecture with pretrained ImageNet weights. Transfer learning is applied by modifying and fine-tuning the model for the target dataset. The workflow includes image preprocessing, batch inference, and performance evaluation.

### üé¢ Processes

1. **Data Preparation** ‚Äì Load images in ImageNet-style folder structure, resize and normalize inputs  
2. **Model Loading** ‚Äì Load ResNet-50d from `timm` with pretrained weights  
3. **Fine-tuning** ‚Äì Replace final classification layer, freeze base layers if necessary, and retrain on custom classes  
4. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Use classification metrics and visual inspection of predicted labels  
5. **Inference Demo** ‚Äì Perform single image predictions for hands-on verification  

### üéØ Results & Impact

- **High accuracy** in top-1 predictions on custom dataset samples  
- **Transfer learning** reduced training time and improved generalization with minimal labeled data
