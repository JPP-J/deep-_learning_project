## Chat with LLM Projects Project ðŸ’¬

- **Description**:  
  Hands-on Python prototype showcasing an interactive chat application using the Qwen and Qwen2.5 LLMs. Built with GPU acceleration (`torch-cuda`) and powered by `transformers`, it includes reusable example functions to demonstrate message handling, response generation, and history maintenance.

- **Prototype Scope**:  
  This prototype demonstrates how to build an interactive chat system using large language models (LLMs) with preserved message history. It simulates human-like conversations by maintaining context between turns and generating context-aware replies.

- **Libraries Used**:
  - **Processing:** `torch-cuda`
  - **Deep Learning/AI:** `transformers`

- **Models**: Qwen, Qwen2.5

- **Features**:
  - Preserves multi-turn chat history for continuity
  - Example functions to send/receive messages
  - Supports conversational AI experimentation

- **Deliverables**:
  - Hands-on Demo Notebook: [`DL_8_chat_LLM.ipynb`](DL_8_chat_LLM.ipynb)
